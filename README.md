### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro Martinez, a.k.a [@alexito4](https://twitter.com/alexito4). I'm a Software Developer currently based in the beautiful city of Girona in Catalonia, Spain. 

I love to share my knowledge and so I spent a bunch of time writing educational content, mostly about Swift and iOS development, on my [website](https://alejandromp.com). I also create video content for my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfiBFlVY8s-tmJGDMNCd26w).
